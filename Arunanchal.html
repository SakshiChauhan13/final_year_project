          Arunachal Pradesh History
        </h2>
  <input type="checkbox" class="read-more-state" id="post-1" />
  <p class="read-more-wrap"> Northeastern India's Arunachal Pradesh lit. "Dawn-Lit Mountain Province" is a state. It was created from the North-East Frontier Agency (NEFA) territory, and on February 20, 1987, India formally recognized it as a state. Its largest town and capital is Itanagar. It shares a southern border with the Indian states of Nagaland and Assam. Its international borders are shared by Myanmar in the east, Bhutan in the west, and the McMahon Line, a disputed 1,129-kilometer boundary with China's Tibet Autonomous Region, in the north.<span class="read-more-target"> China claims Arunachal Pradesh as a component of the Tibet Autonomous Region; In 1962, China invaded parts of Arunachal Pradesh but subsequently withdrew its troops. Arunachal Pradesh is home to 1,383,727 people and covers 83,743 square kilometers (32,333 square miles) as of the 2011 Indian Census. It is the least populated state in India, with only 17 people per square kilometre. The state is home to a diverse population, with the Monpa people residing in the west, the Tani people in the center, the Mishmi and Tai people in the east, and the Naga people in the southeast. The state is home to about 100 sub-tribes and 26 major tribes, including the Nocte, Adi, Nyshi, Singpho, Galo, Tagin, and Apatani [citation needed]. There are three sub-tribes within the Mishmi tribe: Idu-Mishmi, Digaru-Mishmi, and Miju-Mishmi.</p>

  <h1>The Abor and Mishmi hills</h1>
  <img src="https://madaboutbirdingandtravel.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/pano_20181228_065637.jpg?w=816">
    <p class="para" style=" text-align: justify;"> The Abor and Mishmi hills, the Tirap frontier tract in the south, the Sadiya frontier tract in the east, and the Balipara frontier tract in the west were all established by agreements the British Indian government made with the indigenous peoples of northeastern India during the 1912–13 Himalayan mountain region. These tracts combined to form what is now Arunachal Pradesh, the North East Frontier Agency. Known as the McMahon Line, it marks the northern boundary of the territory (now a state) and has long been a source of dispute between China and India. It is approximately 550 miles (885 km) long.
        The boundary bears the name of Sir Henry McMahon, who served as the secretary in the Indian Foreign Department and represented Great Britain at the 1912–13 conference to settle border and other matters pertaining to Tibet that was held in Simla (now Shimla, in the state of Himachal Pradesh). Delegates from China, Tibet, and Great Britain agreed that the boundary between Tibet and northeastern India should indeed follow the crest of the high Himalayas. To the British, the line delineated the administrative, ethnic, and geographic divide between the two regions. However, the republican government in China disowned its delegate and declined to sign a convention two days later.
       China asserted claims to nearly the entire upland region of the then-state of Assam following India's independence in 1947, claiming that the McMahon Line was the product of British aggression and that China had never recognized it. Zhou Enlai, the prime minister of China, cited a map from the 1929 Encyclopædia Britannica that identified the disputed territory as Chinese, with the boundary aligning with Chinese maps, in correspondence with Jawaharlal Nehru, the prime minister of India. Prior to 1935, the North East Frontier Agency, or Arunachal Pradesh, was included in some Chinese maps as part of India; after that, it was included in Tibet. The disputed tribal areas were shown as being de facto administered by British India in the Survey of India (1883). Since 1914, the McMahon Line has been largely followed on Indian and British maps. The Indian-Chinese border would essentially follow the edge of the Assam plain if the Chinese claims were accepted; this would make the border nearly impossible to defend. After that disagreement, on August 26, 1959, Chinese forces crossed the McMahon Line and took control of an Indian outpost at Longju, which is located just south of the line. They left that outpost behind in 1961, but they crossed the border once more in October 1962—this time with force—during the month-long Sino-Indian War. The Chinese launched their attack along the entire border after initially focusing on the Tanglha ridge and Tawang, which are close to the Bhutanese border. Deep slashes were made several times. Subsequently, the Chinese consented to retreat roughly to the McMahon Line, and in 1963, they released Indian troops detained as POWs.

        Since then, attempts have been made to incorporate the area into India to a greater extent; in 1972, the region was designated as a union territory, and fifteen years later, it became a state. Even though it has been gradual, economic growth has increased, especially since part of the state's enormous hydroelectric potential has been developed. The state's first rail line, additional roads into isolated regions, and improved telecommunications, electricity, and water access in tribal villages are just a few of the infrastructure improvements made in Arunachal. But some of those initiatives have alarmed environmentalists and other people who want to protect the natural environment.
        Though tensions have remained high, there haven't been any instances of open hostilities between China and India in Arunachal Pradesh since 1962. Along the de facto international border, both nations have kept troops, and there have been sporadic reports of incursions by either side. There have been brief stints of central government rule, but the Indian National Congress has dominated both the territory and the subsequent state government.</p>
