                          Assam History
                        </h2>
                  <input type="checkbox" class="read-more-state" id="post-1" />
                     
<p class="read-more-wrap"> The most guarded region in eastern India is Assam, which boasts breathtakingly beautiful scenery. The Brahmaputra and Barak rivers, along with a chain of hills and other lush greenery, adorn the State. Since the beginning of time, it has been home to numerous racial, tribal, and ethnic groups. The process of racial synthesis and assimilation elevates and enriches Assam. 
 Divergent views exist regarding the etymology of the name "Assam." Both the names "Pragjyotisha" and "Kamrupa" were used to refer to ancient Assam in Sanskrit literature. The fact that it is mentioned in the Puranas as well as the two great epics, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, proves its antiquity. With reference to the term "Prajyotisha" or "Pragjyotishpura," Gait (1992, reprint) explains that Jyotisha is "a star," astrologically speaking, and Prag means "former" or "eastern." Therefore, it is possible to interpret Pragjyotishpur as the "City of Eastern Astrology."   
     Kamarupa's references can be found in numerous epigraphs and in literature. According to the mythology surrounding the origin of the name Kamarupa, Sati died as a result of her father Daksha's rudeness toward her husband. Shiva, overcome with grief, wandered the world carrying her corpse. Vishnu broke the body into pieces with his discus to stop this, and the pieces fell into different places. After one of these pieces fell on the Nilachal Hills, which are close to Gauhati, the area became revered as Kamakhya. Shiva continued to perform penances, so the gods sent Kamdev, the cupid, to break his vow of chastity by causing him to fall in love. Kamdev accomplished his goal, but Siva, furious at this outcome, destroyed Kamdev with fire. The nation became known as Kamarupa (Where Kama regained his Rupa or form) after Kamdev eventually assumed his original form here.  
    Although the origin is unclear, it is thought that the modern name Assam is an anglicization of the Ahoms, who arrived in Assam in 1228 A.D., and gave the name "Aham" or "Asom." 
    After arriving in Assam, the Ahom people fully assimilated and ruled the region for almost six centuries. One of the greatest eras in Assamese history is the Ahom era. Sukaphaa, a Shan prince of Mong Mao, arrived in Assam after he crossed the Patkai Mountains and founded the Ahom dynasty. During the 13th and 19th centuries, Assamese history saw the rise of multiple tribal communities. During Assamese medieval times, the three most important tribal groups were the Koch, Kacharis, and Chutias. After the Burmese invaded Assam and the British East India Company annexed the region after the Treaty of Yandaboo was signed in 1826, the dynasty came to an end. The colonial era of Assam began when the British emperor assumed power over the state.
    <span class="read-more-target">Assam lost a great deal of its land to newly formed states inside its borders. In 1832, the British annexed Cachar, and in 1835, the Jaintia Hills. Assam was divided into its own province in 1874, with Shillong serving as its capital. As India was divided, Sylhet was combined with East Bengal. The district of Sylhet (apart from the Karimganj subdivision) was given to Pakistan upon India's partition and independence in 1947 (the eastern part of which later became Bangladesh). 
    But just like every other Indian state, Assam took part in a number of freedom movements. With the fervent support of numerous brave activists, Assam became an integral part of India in 1950. When Dewangiri in North Kamrupa was given to Bhutan in 1951, its area was further reduced. Assam's capital was formerly Shillong, which is now the capital of Meghalaya. In 1972, the capital moved to Dispur, a Guwahati suburb. Meghalaya, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, and Mizoram were granted their own states.  Assam's history has gone through several phases of development to get to where it is now.  Assam's history can be separated into four periods. The ancient era began in the 4th century with the mention of Kamarupa in Samudragupta's inscriptions on the Allahabad pillar and the establishment of the Kamarupa kingdom. After the ancient kingdom broke up and medieval kingdoms and chieftainships sprouted in its place, the medieval era began with the attacks from the Bengal Sultanate, the first of which was carried out in 1206 by Bakhtiyar Khilji as mentioned in the Kanai-boroxiboa rock inscription. The colonial era began with the establishment of British control after the Treaty of Yandaboo in 1826, and the post-colonial era began in 1947 after the Independence of India.
    The first Governor of independent Assam was Sir Muhammad Saleh Akbar Hydari and Chief Minister was Gopinath Bordoloi who witnessed the foundations laid of Gauhati University (1948), Gauhati High Court (1948) and Guwahati station of All India Radio (AIR). When Gopinath Bordoloi passed away in 1950, Bishnu Ram Medhi took over as the next Chief Minister of Assam. During his tenure from 1950 to 1957, the First Five-Year Plan was started, Panchayat system of governance was introduced and the agricultural sector got more importance.
    Bimla Prasad Chaliha was the third chief minister from 1957 to 1970. In 1958th the 66th session of Congress was held at Jalukbari, Guwahati. The Saraighat Bridge was constructed over the Brahmaputra river (1965), an Oil refinery was established at Noonmati, Guwahati in 1962 during his time. In 1959-60 the famous language revolt took place in Assam, and as a result Assamese became the official language of the State and Bengali also enjoyed the same status in the Cachar District of Barak Valley.
       Mohendra Mohan Choudhury assumed the mantle of chief minister in 1970. The foundation of Bongaigaon Petro-Chemicals, Paper Mill at Jogighopa and Jute factory at Silghat in Nagaon were laid in his tenure. In 1972 Sarat Chandra Sinha came to power after Congress secured absolute majority. In 1974 the capital was finally shifted to Dispur in Guwahati. 
     The Assam Movement (1979-1985) was a popular movement against illegal immigrants in Assam. The movement, led by All Assam Students Union (AASU) and the All Assam Gana Sangram Parishad (AAGSP), developed a program of protests and demonstration to compel the Indian government to identify and expel illegal, (mostly Bangladeshisi), immigrants and protect and provide constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards to the indigenous Assamese people. The agitation programs were largely non-violent, but the Nellie massacre was a case of extreme violence. The agitation program ended in August 1985 following the Assam Accord, which was signed by leaders of AASU-AAGSP and the Government of India.    
    The Assam Accord (1985) was a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) signed between representatives of the Government of India and the leaders of the Assam Movement in New Delhi on 15 August 1985. A six-year agitation demanding identification and deportation of illegal immigrants was launched by the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) in 1979. It culminated with the signing of the Assam Accord.
    Today Assam has an area of 78,438 square kilometers. It consists of thirty three districts and is credited to be the most populous state in the entire Northeast India.
